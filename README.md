# PINNs Settlement of Footing

This repository contains a Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) implementation in PyTorch to simulate the vertical settlement of a shallow footing on an elastic soil.

## Features

- Solve 2D elasticity PDEs using PINNs
- Apply gravity and footing load
- Plot displacement heatmaps: ux, uy, and total |u|
- GPU-accelerated (CUDA)

## Model
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Strong form PDE equilibrium equation
